# python-api-challenge Some of this code was derived from the datasets that were used in class. The xpert learning assistant helped with a section of the code that I hashed in the script. I also noticed that the graphic plots with the world map are not showing on the VacationPy file on github but they are showing on jupyter notebook. I am assuming this is some compatibility issue with the graphics and github.
